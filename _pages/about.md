I am a Senior Engineer/Researcher in at Alibaba Group@Sunnyvale. My research focuses on designing and building datacenter-scale network with bare-metal performance, high reliability, high cost-efficiency, and ease of management, by leveraging emerging technical trends in SDN and silicon programmability.
